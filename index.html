project site: https://github.com/divya8317/base project description : Our project is to provide a small grocery store with a software application that allows users to make home deliveries. Users can use their credentials to log in to system applications and select items for home delivery. You can also make online payments for the products you had and save your shipping address. This is a simple and basic design. .</p>
